Project: News Website

This project is a news website that I created using my basic web development skills. 
I utilized only HTML and CSS to design a user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing interface.

Features:

Fully Responsive Design: The site displays seamlessly across different devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
Modern Design: Offers a clean and stylish appearance that aligns with current web design trends.
User Experience: Designed with navigation in mind to ensure easy browsing for users.
Technologies:
HTML
CSS
This project is a significant step in my web development journey, 
and I aim to enhance it further by learning advanced technologies like JavaScript in the future.
